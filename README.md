# Movie-Recommendation-System-
This project implements a content-based Movie Recommendation System using Python. By analyzing movie metadata (genre, cast, crew, overview, keywords, etc.), the system suggests similar movies based on a userâ€™s input. We use TF-IDF vectorization, cosine similarity, and NLP techniques like stemming to build a feature-rich recommendation engine.

The core stack includes:

Pandas and NumPy for data processing

Scikit-learn for machine learning and vectorization

NLTK for natural language preprocessing

Streamlit for building an interactive web application

Users can type a movie name into the interface and get five similar movie recommendations, along with posters fetched via an API. The system demonstrates how machine learning can enhance user experience in content-driven applications and can be extended to other domains like books or music.
